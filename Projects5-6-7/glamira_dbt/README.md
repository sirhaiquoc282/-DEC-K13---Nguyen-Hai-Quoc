# DBT Project Documentation

## Overview
This project utilizes dbt (Data Build Tool) to transform and model data efficiently in a data warehouse environment.

## Project Structure
```sh
/dbt_project
│── models/
│   ├── staging/        # Staging models
│   ├── analytics/      # Business logic models
│── tests/              # Test cases
│── seeds/              # Seed files
│── macros/             # Reusable SQL macros
│── dbt_project.yml     # DBT project configuration
```

## Installation
To set up dbt for this project, install dbt by running:
```sh
pip install dbt-bigquery  # or other adapters like dbt-postgres, dbt-snowflake
```
Then, configure dbt by running:
```sh
dbt init
```

## Running dbt Commands
- Compile models:
  ```sh
  dbt compile
  ```
- Run models:
  ```sh
  dbt run
  ```
- Execute tests:
  ```sh
  dbt test
  ```
- Run a specific model:
  ```sh
  dbt run --select model_name
  ```

## Testing
This project includes both **singular tests** (custom SQL assertions) and **generic tests** (built-in dbt tests like `unique`, `not_null`).

## Deployment
To deploy the models, use:
```sh
dbt build
```
This command runs models, tests, snapshots, and seeds in the correct order.
